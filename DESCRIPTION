        Mediator

Description: A causal mediation approach under the counterfactual framework 
    to test the significance of total, direct and indirect effects. In this approach, 
    a group of methylated sites from a predefined region are utilized as the mediator, 
    and the functional transformation is used to reduce the possible high dimension 
    in the region-based methylated sites and account for their location information.
